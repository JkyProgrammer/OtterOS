# OtterOS
OtterOS is a hybrid operating system written in C++. It was designed to make the most of all the best points of currently software, in a cross-platform format. We have experience in lots of different operating systems, and pieces of software, and had the idea of making a perfect 'unified' single operating system. We also like the idea of cross-platform applications: making production and distribution easier for both developer and user. We want to unify the interface style and filesystem setup, so the OS runs just the same on tablet or desktop. We also aim for fast bootups, efficient program design and speed, and of course: nice looking, user-and-dev-friendly design.

## Intentions
* Beautiful but simple UI
* Efficient and fast
* Productivity built-in
* Support for applications from other OS's without requiring a virtual machine
* Can run on desktop or tablet:
  * Touch and mouse support
  * Onscreen keyboard
  * UI and file setups which run nicely on either
  * A single build for any device with a given architecture (i.e. even if the device type is different (tablet, desktop), but the architecture is the same, a single build will suffice)
  * Portability of content from other platforms
