# OtterOS
OtterOS is an operating system written in C++. It was intended to make the most of all the best points of current software, in a cross-platform format.

## Intentions
* Beautiful but simple UI
* Efficient and fast
* Productivity built-in
* Support for applications from other OS's without requiring a virtual machine
* Can run on desktop or tablet:
  * Touch and mouse support
  * Onscreen keyboard
  * UI and file setups which run nicely on either
  * A single build for any device with a given architecture (i.e. even if the device type is different (tablet, desktop), but the architecture is the same, a single build will suffice)
  * Portability of content from other platforms
